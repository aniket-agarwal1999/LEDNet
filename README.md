# LEDNet

#### A Lightweight Encoder-Decoder Network for real-time semantic segmentation

This is the unofficial implementation of the paper [LEDNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02423.pdf).

This repo contains the whole model architecture for the LEDNet model. You can also view the soon to be released official implementation at this [repo](https://github.com/xiaoyufenfei/LEDNet). Apart from this, I have tried to replicate the model to the very best given in the paper and have even used some inspiration for the missing information from the [ENet model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02147.pdf). Hope you will find this model useful :smile:
